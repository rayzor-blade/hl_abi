//! The HashLink C ABI, as a native library sees it.
//!
//! An HDLL includes `hl.h` and links against libhl; this is the same thing in
//! Rust, shared by every library in this repo that is one.
//!
//! # Portable names and ash's
//!
//! HashLink exports its runtime as `hl_*`. ash exports those, and also a set
//! of `hlp_*` functions of its own, so a library reaching for an `hlp_` name
//! runs on ash and nowhere else. Where both exist the doc comment says which
//! to use.
//!
//! **This crate must never gain a dependency on `ash_std`, or define a symbol
//! of its own.** Everything here is either a `#[repr(C)]` layout the runtime
//! and a library must agree on, or a function the runtime exports, so a
//! library built on it links nothing of the runtime into itself. Depending on
//! the runtime as a Rust crate would put a second copy of its `#[no_mangle]`
//! exports in the library's archive, and two strong definitions of one name
//! cannot be linked.

// These are `hl.h`'s names, spelled its way on purpose: someone checking this
// against the header should be able to read the two side by side.
